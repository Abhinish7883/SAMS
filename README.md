The aims of the project is making agriculture smart using automation and IOT technologies. This IOT based Agriculture monitoring system makes use of wireless sensor networks that collects data from different sensors deployed at various nodes and sends it through the wireless protocol. This smart agriculture using IOT system is powered by Arduino, it consist of Temperature sensor, Moisture sensor, Water level sensor, PIR sensor(It is used to detect the movement of people,animals or other  objects ), DC  motor, GPRS module.
